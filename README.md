“Fractional Finance Made Simple”

DivvyFi is a financial technology company on a mission to create more inclusive, accessible, shared, and fairly distributed ownership of real assets that aren’t accessible through traditional finance. 

The term DivvyFi is a fusion of two ideas:
“Divvy” = to divide, share, or split something fairly (like splitting costs, profits, or investments).


“Fi” = shorthand for finance, fintech, or financial innovation.
Think Robinhood meets Airbnb for real assets fractional ownership. DivvyFi helps groups of trusted investors (close friends, family, and business partners)  pool capital, buy RWA (Real World Assets), and build wealth together.
